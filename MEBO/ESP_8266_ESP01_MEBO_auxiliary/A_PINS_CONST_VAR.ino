/* Setting GPIO3 (RX) as an OUTPUT is NOT recommended if you can avoid it because
  it is easy to short out when next re-programming. Note carefully: If you are using
  GPIO3 (RX) as an output, add a small resistor say 330R in series to prevent accidentally
  shorting it out when you attach your programming leads.*/

/*
  The GPIO0 and GPIO2 determine what mode the module starts up in and the TX/RX pins
  are used to program the module and for Serial I/O, commonly used for debugging.
